 🏚️ Flint's Dream House 🧸💤


 💡 Concept  
I set out to create a mascot horror game that taps into childhood nostalgia and blends it with nightmare fuel. Picture this: abandoned playgrounds, surreal creatures, and relentless chases through a facility that doesn't quite follow the laws of physics... or sanity.

🎮 The Game  
You play as **Flint**, a trapped soul navigating a mysterious, ever-shifting facility.  
Explore strange, decaying playrooms and confront bizarre mascots born from your deepest fears.  
Each encounter brings you one step closer to unraveling the haunting curse rooted within your mind.

This is **Chapter One** of a larger descent into memory, madness, and monsters.

🧠 Reflections  
Some levels didn’t quite hit the mark, and the cat-themed character felt like a spontaneous decision—but I went with it anyway.  
While this version has its rough edges, it's a starting point. I’m already dreaming of reimagining this idea with stronger characters and a sharper concept.

📁 Final Notes  
I may or may not publish the full version here, but I wanted to document this project as a creative milestone.  
Hopefully, future-me can look back and see how far I’ve come in the world of mascot horror design 🧵👣
